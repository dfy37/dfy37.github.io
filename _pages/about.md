I'm a third year graduate student from Beihang University. My research interest includes natural language processing, machine learning, and LLM.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Wenge Rong](https://wgrong.github.io/) from School of Computer Science, Beihang University.

You can find my CV here: [Feiyu Duan's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/CV.pdf).
